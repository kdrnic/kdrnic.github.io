<h3>Configuring Tapegro for MS-DOS</h3>
You'll likely want use_vsync not to be set, as not all graphics modes support vsync anyway.<br>
The window_w,window_h,color_depth must correspond to an existing graphics mode. 320,200,8 is the classic mode 13h, highly recommended.<br>
<h3>Other things to keep in mind</h3>
Be careful with filenames - keep all your resources in MS-DOS 8.3 filename format (8 for name, 3 for extension).
<h3>Testing performance under DOSBox</h3>
The following two lines can be typed into DOSBox to simulate a 486:
<pre>
core=normal
cycles=26800
</pre>
Alternatively, use cycles value of 77000 for a Pentium I.<br>
One can see that performance is often not so brilliant - if you want your game played like a real MS-DOS era PC could, you will have to optimise carefully. See optimising for MS-DOS, below.
<h3>Things that don't work in MS-DOS</h3>
Currently the differences below are caused by deficits in the older version of Allegro used:
<ul>
<li>TEXT_RIGHT has no effect and will default to TEXT_LEFT
<li>Sprites which are rotated, scaled or both will ignore flips
<li>LoadFont does nothing and just returns the default font
<li>MaskedStretchBlit does an unmasked stretch blit instead
<li>GetMIDILength always returns 0
</ul>
<h3>Optimising for MS-DOS</h3>
It seems most often what will take the most time will be Js execution, not rendering.<br>
Some tips follow:
<h4>Use macros where possible</h3>
You can invoke gcc as below to use it to preprocess files not in the C language:
<pre>
gcc -E -P - < main_src.js > main.js
</pre>
Knowing that, changing this
<pre>
function Move(obj){
	obj.x += obj.dx;
	obj.y += obj.dy;
}

function Collision(a, b){
	return (Math.abs(a.x - b.x) < (a.radius + b.radius) && Math.abs(a.y - b.y) < (a.radius + b.radius));
}
</pre>
into this
<pre>
#define Move(obj)	\
obj.x += obj.dx;	\
obj.y += obj.dy;

#define Collision(a, b) (Math.abs(a.x - b.x) < (a.radius + b.radius) && Math.abs(a.y - b.y) < (a.radius + b.radius))
</pre>
can enable a significant performance improvement, due to the cost of function calls.

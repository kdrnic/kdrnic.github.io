You will also want to check the <a href="allegro_docs\">Allegro documentation's</a> section "Configuration routines" which has at its bottom some Allegro-specific sections and configurations.<br>
To be honest, the only useful ones are listed below:
<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<th>sound</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>midi_card</td>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>If not set, the MIDI card will automatically detected - under MS-DOS, this is likely fine. However, under Windows this will pick the default awful sounding Microsoft synthesizer, and under Linux there may be no MIDI, so you may want to set this to "DIGI" - see the <a href="midi.html">MIDI page.</a></td>

<marquee><h1>GPL HALL OF TORTURE</h1></marquee>
In the fatal year of 1999, John Carmack had the mind to release the Quake source code to be used by all. However, he made the terrible mistake of licensing it as GPL. Terrible<br>
So now almost 2 decades later, Tapegro may suffer from this evil zombie license from Hell, as parts of the Quake net code are simply too convenient - so in the future, as networking ability of Tapegro is released, it may become opensource and released under GPL.

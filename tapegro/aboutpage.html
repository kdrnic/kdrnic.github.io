<center><h1>About the TAPEGRO page</h1></center>
It is obvious that unlike <a href="/">the rest of kdrnic.github.io</a>, Tapegro's page struggles for a late 90/early 2000s aesthetic.<br>
All the HTML was written manually, and includes all the best tags.<br>
All the content is original and made by me, except ALLEGRO.MID which is from the Allegro demo.<br>
The gifs were created using Wings 3D, Gifcam and GIMP.<br>
Wings 3D doesn't have animation features, but it is still possible to animate by moving and rotating pieces around, frame by frame.<br>

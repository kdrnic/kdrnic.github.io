<oranebeast> drnick : are you okay?
<drnick> oranebeast, why do you ask?
<oranebeast> drnick : the game
<drnick> oranebeast, what about it
<oranebeast> its different
* badgerdash (badgerdash@badgerdash.Users.AfterNET.Org) has joined
<drnick> I'd say I am slightly in the blues
<drnick> oranebeast, my highscore is 4625
* mmango has quit (Ping timeout)
* Enrymion has quit (Ping timeout)
<oranebeast> drnick : I play for a little, sorta worryin
* KK has quit (Ping timeout)
<the31> I can't not die in longer than 10 seconds or so.
<the31> Also: suggest naming "this week in drnick's world"?
<the31> Although... I dunno, the disparity in subject matter is bizarre.
<drnick> it is about life the31 
<drnick> there is so much to be said about it
<drnick> for example the first level about love is the one that can give you the most points at first
* badgerdash|srv has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
* badgerdash|srv (badgerdash@badgerdash.Users.AfterNET.Org) has joined
<drnick> to survive you have to be close, since the hearts spread
<drnick> just like you can't avoid being hurt by love by being distant
<drnick> the second level is easy, but the cake doesn't give too many points, and you can't eat fast enough
* badgerdash has quit (Ping timeout)
<drnick> the third level is the only one where the theoretical maximal amount of points increases with time...
<drnick> in fact, if you stay after drnick is hit, you can watch as more and more money appears
<drnick> each time you rotate through all the stages
<drnick> but in reality it gives little at the start, and you don't survive enough for it to be relevant
<the31> I think I'm biased against things that claim to be about life. :/
<drnick> and the last level is the most dangerous
<drnick> and you survive it almost randomly
<drnick> like death comes when you don't expect it
* badgerdash (badgerdash@badgerdash.Users.AfterNET.Org) has joined
* Kalias has quit (Ping timeout)
<drnick> the31, why?
<g12345> i like the idea its called life
<g12345> and not some "i have to be incredibly precise in what i have to claim"
<the31> Why do I think that: because they always seem silly and look like a joke; why do I have that bias: maybe because I don't have a normal life.
<the31> The game's getting quite fast now, hah
<g12345> but i do wish the name was a bit more funny
* K4T has quit (Quit)
<the31> "How the world seems to accelerate as you get older" I suppose.
<drnick> oh
<drnick> yeah, that is a good analysis, the31 
<drnick> so now it is canon
<the31> \o/
* Sheepolution has quit (Ping timeout)
<drnick> see, it only becomes deeper the more you think about it


<bitslap> i like that you could avoid the broken hearts by getting inbetween the pieces
<bitslap> sort of poetic

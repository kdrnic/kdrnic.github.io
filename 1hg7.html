My 7th entry for the <a href="http://onehourgamejam.com">One Hour Game Jam</a> event.<br>
<br>
The theme was &quot;solidarity&quot;, but notably I made this game with the theme from the week before, &quot;bitslap&apos;s birthday jam&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is ostensibly based on events which happened in the world during the week before. These include an article I gave a presentation on, bitslap&apos;s birthday, the Charlie Ebdo attack, and one event in kdrnic&apos;s life, in order of growing importance...<br>
<br>
The version available is slightly redacted compared to the original.<br>
<br>
It is all very puerile, but it was fun and cathartic to make.<br>
